Freeware by Uwe Sieber (c) 2007-2016

Works under Window 2000, XP, and higher

Commandline tool which removes non present devices from the device tree
which match one of the given patterns.

Usage:

DeviceCleanupCmd [-t][-s][-n][-m:min-age] pattern1 [pattern2] [patternN]

-t  test only
-s  skip creation of a system restore point
-n  no wait for key press when finished
-m  minimum age of devices to remove

patterns are device IDs to remove, wildcards can be used.

Samples:

remove all non present devices whose device IDs begin with HID\\VID_045E
DeviceCleanupCmd HID\VID_045E*

remove all non present devices whose device IDs contain VID_045E
DeviceCleanupCmd *VID_045E*

remove all non present devices
DeviceCleanupCmd *

remove all non present devices not used for at least one year
DeviceCleanupCmd * -m:1y

Units are y - year, m - month, d - days, h - hours, i - minutes, s - seconds

Test mode (shows which devices would be removed)
DeviceCleanupCmd * -t


The device's 'age' time comes from the write time of the device's registry key
under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum

On some Windows the times are set on startup, so all devices seem to have
the same age. On most Windows the time is set when the device gets active.

Non-PnP devices and 'soft' devices are not deleted because they are not automatically
reinstalled. These are devices whose ID begins with
- HTREE\ROOT\
- ROOT\
- SW\{

If you want to delete them, use the Windows Device Manager.


Under x64 edtitions of Windows only the x64 version works.

Administrator previleges are required for cleanup.

A GUI version is available too:
